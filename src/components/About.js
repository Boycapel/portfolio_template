            <p>
                Hi my name is Mark,
                I'm a self taught Solidity Developer.I live in New Jersey, in the suburb's of
                New York City. My background is actually very different from being a blockchain Developer,
                having been in sales, construction, and now IT. Being accustomed to working and selling
                credit repair services, to installing polished concrete floors. I'm no stranger to hardwork,
                long hours, and deadlines. After a few run-ins with danger and nearly losing my eye I decided to shutdown 
                the business and career for the better. Below you can find the projects i've taken and worked on, now I'm set
                on having my own project Frission.Finance to be able to put together everything I know.

            </p>
